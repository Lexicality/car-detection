# Random Encounters
The fourth iteration of my stupid [Pesterchum] bot.

I made the original in 2011ish in perl, then the second one as an exercise to learn C++. After that I completely rewrote it again because noob C++ is terrible and since it's apparently still needed here's a Go version because I don't understand anything I wrote the first 3 times. Maybe I'll end up rewriting it again in another 4 years, who knows.
